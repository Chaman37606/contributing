Contributing to Ladybug Tools Projects
=========================================

Thank you for considering contributing to Ladybug Tools. We welcome contributions to all
our [projects on Github](http://www.github.com/ladybug-tools) and from anyone, even if
you are new to open source we will be happy to help you to get started. Most of the
Ladybug Tools developers started learning programming through developing for Ladybug Tools.

Issues
------
Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests to each repository.

Contributing
------------
Please refer to each project's contributing file for style guidelines. In general, we
follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

If you don't know what is Git read the section for [new users](#new-users).

NOTES:
 1. Be sure to open an issue or contact the current developers and let them know about your
 desire to work on the project. This will ensure that no one else is working on the same
 problem and also provides the opportunity for us to help you to get started with development.
 2. Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!
 3. An acceptable **Pull request** should not be more than 200 lines of changes otherwise
 it will be very hard for us to review the code.
 4. Read the contributing.md of the project beforehand to ensure your pull request meets
 the requirement of the project.

Style guide
-----------
 For Python projects see Ladybug Tools [Python style guide](
 https://github.com/ladybug-tools/contributing/wiki/python-style-guide).
 
 Please also take a look at the zen of Python by Tim Peters. To read the Zen of Python, please write 
 ```import this``` in your Python shell.

  You will need to supply a username and email address and to create a password.

  After you have registered you can go to your [GitHub settings]( https://github.com/settings/profile ).
