Contributing to Ladybug Tools Projects
=========================================

Ladybug Tools welcomes contributions to all our [projects on Github](http://www.github.com/ladybug-tools).

Issues
------

Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests to each repository.

Contributing
------------

Please refer to each project's contributing file for style guidelines. In general, we
follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

NOTES:
 1. Be sure to open an issue or contact the current developers and let them know about your
 desire to work on the project. This will ensure that no one else is working on the same
 problem and also provides the opportunity for us to help you to get started with development.
 2. Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!
 3. An acceptable **Pull request** should not be more than 200 lines of changes otherwise
 it will be very hard for us to review the code.
 4. Read the contributing.md of the project beforehand to ensure your pull request meets
 the requirement of the project.
